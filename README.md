## Overview

Hi, I'm **Sanjay Patidar** ‚Äî a Full Stack Product Engineer with a strong product mindset and 12+ real-world projects delivered across **serverless**, **cloud-native**, and **SEO-first** architectures.

I specialize in building **production-grade applications** that drive measurable business impact ‚Äî prioritizing performance, scalability, and user-centric outcomes over just shipping features.

üõ†Ô∏è Domains I‚Äôve worked in:
- üìä Government-backed insurance (LIC Neemuch)
- üìö eLearning platforms (Zedemy LMS)
- üìπ Real-time video communication (ConnectNow)
- üìÖ Event coordination (EventEase)
- ü§ñ AI-powered mobile apps (AgriBot for farmers)

Each of my projects is **backed by a real use case**, engineered for production-readiness, performance, and long-term scalability. From serverless deployments to client-side rendering and cloud cost management, every project below is a carefully crafted solution.

## Engineering Themes & Practices

- **SSR for SEO-first Apps:** All major platforms use Helmet and pre-rendered content to enable fast indexing and discoverability.
- **Modular Monorepo Management:** EventEase uses a shared directory with slices split between EventEase and EventPro modules.
- **Optimized Cloud Usage:** AWS Lambda + DynamoDB + Vercel balance cost and scale with no backend server maintenance.
- **Real-World Freelancing:** LIC Neemuch was developed from scratch for a real client with formal SRS, MOU, and ‚Çπ50K valuation.
- **Hybrid Mobile Development:** AgriBot leverages Kotlin with Python backend for AI features, ensuring offline resilience and multilingual support.

## Q&A ‚Äì Frequently Asked Questions

### Q1: Why so much focus on SEO for utility platforms?
> Because discoverability leads to organic growth. Whether it's insurance leads or blog visibility, metadata, SSR, and HTML pre-rendering are crucial.

### Q2: Did you build these alone?
> Yes. I designed, built, deployed, and maintained all platforms solo‚Äîincluding integrations, testing, and documentation.

### Q3: Are these portfolio-only or live production apps?
> Each project is deployed and indexed. LIC Neemuch is used by real LIC officers. Zedemy has a live user base. EventEase and ConnectNow are fully functional and hosted. AgriBot is a downloadable Android app with real-world AI utility for farmers.

### Q4: Why serverless everywhere?
> I prefer low-maintenance deployments. Lambda + Vercel + MongoDB provide the right balance of performance and cost, especially for early-stage platforms.

### Q5: Any reusable modules or design patterns?
> Yes. Shared Redux slices, serverless functions, authentication flows, SSR logic, and AI integrations (like LangChain in AgriBot) are reused and customized per use case.

## Final Thoughts

This repository isn‚Äôt a list of template-based clones. It‚Äôs a curated, engineered set of platforms born from a developer‚Äôs journey toward mastering real-world software delivery.

Every decision‚ÄîSSR, STUN, role-based routing, SEO tuning, caching headers, AI backend chaining‚Äîwas made with long-term scalability and performance in mind.
